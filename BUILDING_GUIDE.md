# 🏗 Step-by-Step Building Guide: MIT Lost & Found System

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning 🎯

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup
1. Created a new React project with TypeScript
2. Installed necessary packages:
   - Shadcn/UI for components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - React Router for navigation
   - Lucide React for icons

### Step 2: Authentication System Setup 🔐
1. Created authentication types in `src/types/auth.ts`
2. Implemented AuthContext in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`:
   - Login functionality
   - Signup with enrollment verification
   - User state management
   - Mock authentication system

### Step 3: Mock Data Setup 📊
1. Created `mockEnrollments.ts` with sample enrollment data
2. Added test accounts:
   - Student: student@mit.edu / password123
   - Admin: admin@mit.edu / admin123

## Phase 2: Core Components Development 🛠

### Step 4: Layout and Navigation
1. Created base Layout component with:
   - Responsive navbar
   - Footer
   - Container setup

### Step 5: Authentication Pages
1. Built Login page with:
   - Email/password form
   - Role selection (Student/Admin)
   - Error handling
   - Success notifications

2. Built Signup page with:
   - Student registration form
   - Enrollment number verification
   - Password validation
   - Success/error notifications

### Step 6: Student Dashboard 📱
1. Created protected routes
2. Built dashboard sections:
   - Overview cards
   - Recent activity
   - Item tracking
   - Profile information
   - Settings panel

### Step 7: Admin Features 👨‍💼
1. Implemented admin-only routes
2. Created enrollment management:
   - View all enrollments
   - Track used/unused numbers
   - Basic management functions

## Phase 3: Item Management System 📦

### Step 8: Item Related Components
1. Created ItemCard component for consistent item display
2. Implemented item reporting system
3. Added item details page
4. Built claim submission system

### Step 9: Mock Data Management 💾
1. Set up local storage system
2. Created mock item data
3. Implemented basic search and filter

## Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements 🎨

### Step 10: UI/UX Improvements
1. Added loading states
2. Implemented error boundaries
3. Added toast notifications
4. Enhanced responsive design

### Step 11: Final Touches ✨
1. Added documentation
2. Created test credentials
3. Implemented basic error handling
4. Added placeholder data

## Current Limitations 🚧
1. No real backend - using mock data
2. Local storage only
3. Basic security implementation
4. Simulated enrollment verification

## Next Steps 🔜
1. Real database integration
2. Backend API development
3. Real authentication system
4. Advanced item matching
5. Email notifications
6. Mobile app development

## Testing The System 🧪

### Student Flow Testing:
1. Visit the login page
2. Use test credentials: student@mit.edu / password123
3. Try reporting a lost item
4. Check dashboard functionality

### Admin Flow Testing:
1. Visit the login page
2. Use admin credentials: admin@mit.edu / admin123
3. Check enrollment management
4. Review mock data

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

1. If login fails:
   - Check if using correct test credentials
   - Verify enrollment number format
   - Clear browser cache if needed

2. If items don't appear:
   - Check local storage
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify user permissions

## Development Tips 💡

1. Keep console open for debugging
2. Use React Developer Tools
3. Check Network tab for request simulation
4. Test responsive design with different screen sizes

Remember: This is a prototype version focusing on demonstrating functionality rather than production-ready features.
